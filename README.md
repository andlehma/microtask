# microtask
frontend-only version of my old todo list app: [minitask](https://github.com/andlehma/minitask)

Because my old todo list app MiniTask is offline and I'm applying for jobs now, I decided to re-write the frontend for my portfolio. I re-wrote it mostly from scratch to refresh myself on React and to make sure the code is something I'd want to show off. Then I re-re-wrote it using React Hooks instead of class components. Please hire me.
